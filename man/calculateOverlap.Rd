\item{feat_info}{character. Name of vector feature information to overlap}

\item{image_names}{character vector. Name(s) of the image feature information
to overlap}

\item{poly_subset_ids}{(optional) character vector of poly_IDs to use}

\item{return_gobject}{return giotto object (default: TRUE)}

\item{verbose}{be verbose}

\item{\dots}{additional params to pass to methods}

\item{y}{Object with features to overlap: \code{giottoPoints}, \code{giottoLargeImage},
\code{SpatVector} points or \code{SpatRaster}}

\item{return_gpolygon}{default = TRUE. Whether to return the entire
giottoPolygon provided to \code{x}, but with the overlaps information appended or
as a bare terra \code{SpatVector}}
